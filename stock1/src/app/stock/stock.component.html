  <div class="centered"><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers

    and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity)

    of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include

     securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately,

     such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding

     platforms. Investment in the stock market is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic

    trading platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.

    Stocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example,

    Nestlé and Novartis are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange, so they may

     be considered as part of the Swiss stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on

     exchanges in other countries, for example, as American depository receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock

     markets.</i></p>
